# multi_robot_architecture_decentralized_blockchain

Multi-robot systems are groups of robots that coordinate to complete a given task. In communication based systems, the integrity of the information shared between robots becomes highly important as any security threat due to a malicious node in the system can cause a chain reaction to compromise the entire system. This paper proposes a Hybridized Blockchain Model based Architecture (HBMA) built on Robot Operating system (ROS) which offers a semidecentralized environment into which any communication based algorithm can be plugged in. A security monitoring system is also provided with the architecture that identifies and shuts down malicious robots while also sending out alerts
about the threat. This architecture is used to create secured, coupled approaches
to localization of multi-robots and multi-robot path planning. Existing decentralized non-coupled algorithms such as Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle (RVO)
and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) are modified to create coupled
approaches to multi-robot path planning with reduced communication overhead
and computational complexity, that is secured by the HBMA. This approach is
validated on both physical robots and simulations run on ROS.
