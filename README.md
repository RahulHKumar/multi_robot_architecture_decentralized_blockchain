Autonomous robots are machines that can act without any human interference. When certain sensors and decision
making algorithms are added to the control unit of a drone,
the aerial vehicle is said to be autonomous. Such vehicles are
capable of avoiding obstacles and correcting their local paths
while staying on planned global paths. Autonomy in drones is
usually achieved using many types of sensors like depth sensor,
stereo camera or lidar, and intensive SLAM algorithms that
require powerful processors. Though the existing methods work
well, the scalability of such products is questionable as the
economic and resource availability factors come into play. This
paper proposes a method of achieving autonomous navigation
using light weight embedded system and affordable monocular
cameras by combining features of image processing and resource
sharing. The proposed architecture makes use of monocular cues
and midas depth estimation model to achieve obstacle avoidance
and can run on any processor with basic features such as serial
communication, wifi and camera ports.
